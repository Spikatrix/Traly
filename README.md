## About

Traly is a tool that helps you to add translations to LRC files. This is done by appending every lyric line with `^` along with the translated lines. 

**Note**: Translations to LRC files separated by the `^` character is a non-standard feature and hence is supported in a few applications only.

## Supported applications

 - [Android] Huawei's stock music player
